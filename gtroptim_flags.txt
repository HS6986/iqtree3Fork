--link-exchange-rates
	This flag indicates to the program that you want to optimize a single rate
	matrix that's linked between every class. It triggers the optimizeLinkedSubst
	method within the ModelMixture class which utilizes BFGS to optimize the
	model parameters. 

--rates-file
	Tells the program to generate a .ratemat file that includes the linked
	exchange rate matrix, assuming the above option is used.

--gtr20-model
	Which model should be used as the starting point when optimizing with
	GTR20. Comes with an associated value: POISSON, or LG.
	By default, it uses POISSON. (previously it defaulted to LG)

--reset-method
	Defines the behavior of the Optimization::restartParameters routine.
	Comes with an associated value: const, or rand. Default: const.
	"const" is the new behavior that we have defined wherein the rate matrix
	values are all multiplied by a constant value if one or more values goes
	over the boundary. "rand" is the previous behavior wherein all values
	are multiplied by random_double() * (upper[i] - lower[i])/3 + lower[i].

--guess-multiplier
	Very closely related to the above option, if the reset method is "const",
	then this controls the constant value by which to multiply each value
	(hereby referred to as "c"). If parameters are detected to go over the
	upper boundary, then every parameter is multiplied by c, if the result isn't
	also under the lower boundary. Conversely, if parameters are detected to go
	under the lower boundary, then every parameter is multiplied by 1/c, if the
	result isn't also over the upper boundary.
